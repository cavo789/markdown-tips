Write a bullet list in markdown and convert it into a `svg` file.

Not yet tried: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/markmap-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markmap-cli). That tools seems to convert the markdown file with markmap into a HTML page. It isn't said how the mindmap is rendered (svg, png, ...)?
